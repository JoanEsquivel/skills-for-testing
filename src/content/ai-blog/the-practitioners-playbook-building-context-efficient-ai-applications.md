## From Knowledge to Action

Parts 1-4 covered the theory (what context engineering is), the foundations (tokens and context windows), the problem space (where tokens go and how context fails), and the techniques (caching, compression, RAG, sub-agents, memory). This final post is the playbook — practical decisions, monitoring, mistakes to avoid, and a checklist you can start using today.

## The Decision Framework: Start Simple, Add Complexity When Needed

Anthropic's guidance is to "do the simplest thing that works." Follow this tiered approach:

### Tier 1: No Infrastructure Changes (Start Here)

These optimizations require only prompt and API parameter changes:

**1. Tighten your prompts.**
"Could you please provide me with a comprehensive overview of my scheduled appointments for today?" → "What's on my calendar today?" (18 tokens → 8 tokens, 2.25x reduction)

At the system prompt level, replace conversational phrasing ("I would like you to always make sure that you...") with direct instructions ("Always..."). These savings multiply across every API call.

**2. Constrain output explicitly.**
- Prompt-level: "Answer in 50 words" or "Return only the JSON object"
- API-level: Set `max_tokens` with a small buffer above expected length
- A 500-token response constrained to 150 tokens saves 4-6x on the most expensive token type

**3. Enable prompt caching.**
- Anthropic: Add `cache_control` to stable prefixes
- OpenAI: Automatic for prompts >1,024 tokens
- Potential savings: 50-90% on input costs

**4. Use efficient output formats.**
For internal processing, use YAML/CSV instead of JSON. JSON's structural characters consume 18-40% more tokens than compact alternatives.

**5. Minimize few-shot examples.**
Many tasks achieve comparable quality with 2-3 examples versus 10-15. Curate "diverse, canonical examples" rather than exhaustive edge cases. Each example is paid for on every call.

**6. Request extraction over generation.**
"Which of these categories fits: A, B, or C?" costs far fewer output tokens than "Categorize and explain your reasoning."

### Tier 2: Moderate Complexity

**7. Implement observation masking.** Hide older tool outputs with placeholders while keeping the reasoning/action trail. 52% cost reduction, simpler than summarization.

**8. Add conversation compaction.** Trigger at 64-75% capacity. Manual compaction at logical breakpoints beats automatic.

**9. Use semantic chunking for retrieval.** Split documents by meaning, not arbitrary token counts. Better retrieval precision means fewer irrelevant chunks in context.

**10. Implement progressive tool disclosure.** Start with minimal tool metadata; load full schemas on demand. 49% → 74% accuracy improvement.

### Tier 3: Architectural Changes

**11. Build RAG pipelines** for knowledge bases exceeding 200K tokens.

**12. Deploy sub-agent architectures** for complex, multi-step tasks that require reading large amounts of data.

**13. Implement three-tier memory** (working + session + persistent) for production agents that need cross-session knowledge.

**14. Add semantic caching** for workloads with repeated or similar queries (up to 73% cost reduction).

Each tier builds on the previous one. Most applications will see significant improvement from Tier 1 alone.

## Monitoring: You Can't Optimize What You Don't Measure

### What to Track

At minimum, per request:
- **Input tokens** (prompt_tokens)
- **Output tokens** (completion_tokens)
- **Cached tokens** (cache hit rate)
- **Latency** (time to first token + total response time)
- **Cost per request**

Break these down by:
- Query type or feature
- User segment (power users generate longer conversations)
- Model (if using multiple models)

### Detecting Problems

| Pattern | Likely Cause |
|---------|-------------|
| Sudden input token spikes | Context accumulation bug (unbounded history) |
| High output token counts | Missing `max_tokens` or verbose prompts |
| Low cache hit rates | Dynamic content before stable content |
| Increasing latency per turn | Unbounded context growth |
| Accuracy degradation over time | Context rot — approaching effective limit |

### Tools

- **Datadog LLM Observability:** End-to-end tracing with prebuilt dashboards
- **Langfuse (open source):** Detailed token breakdowns, self-hosted option
- **Traceloop:** Granular per-user, per-feature monitoring
- **Braintrust:** Evaluation-focused with scoring and comparison
- **Claude Code `/context`:** Built-in token breakdown by category

### Setting Baselines

Before optimizing:
1. Measure system prompt + tool definition tokens (fixed costs)
2. Measure average input/output tokens per request type
3. Calculate effective cache hit rate
4. Compute cost per conversation or cost per task

With baselines, you can set targets and measure the impact of each change.

## RAG vs. Long Context: The Decision Guide

**Use full-context (no RAG) when:**
- Knowledge base < 200K tokens
- You need holistic understanding of the full document
- Prompt caching makes repeated access cheap
- You want the simplest possible architecture

**Use RAG when:**
- Knowledge base > 200K tokens
- Searching across many documents
- Information changes frequently
- Need consistent accuracy regardless of corpus size
- Latency must be under 2 seconds

**Use both when:**
- Mix of stable context (cacheable) and dynamic context (retrievable)
- Different parts of the app have different requirements
- RAG for facts, full context for reasoning

## The Six Most Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Treating Context as Free Storage

Every token costs money, adds latency, and dilutes attention. A 20-turn conversation can accumulate 10,000 tokens when only 1,000 of recent context would suffice.

**Fix:** Implement context budgets. Decide in advance how many tokens each category gets, and enforce those limits.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring the Middle

Due to lost-in-the-middle effects, position matters. The most important information should be at the beginning (system prompt) and end (current query, most relevant retrieved content).

**Fix:** Structure context with critical information first and last. Use the middle for supporting context that's helpful but not critical.

### Mistake 3: Over-Engineering Before Measuring

Adding RAG, compression, and multi-agent architectures before measuring actual usage is solving problems you may not have.

**Fix:** Instrument first. Measure baselines. Identify bottlenecks. Then apply targeted optimizations.

### Mistake 4: Not Testing with Realistic Context Lengths

Developers test with short inputs and are surprised when production contexts — with real conversation history, tool outputs, and retrieved documents — degrade performance.

**Fix:** Test with realistic context lengths. Include edge cases at 70-80% of effective capacity, not just the advertised limit.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Output Tokens Cost More

Developers optimize input while ignoring output — the more expensive side. A 500-token response that could be 100 tokens costs 4-6x more than necessary.

**Fix:** Always set `max_tokens`. Include length constraints in prompts. Prefer extraction over generation.

### Mistake 6: Tool Definition Bloat

A single MCP server like Playwright consumes 11,700 tokens just for definitions. Multiple servers can consume 134,000 tokens — 67% of a 200K window.

**Fix:** Load tools selectively. Only include definitions relevant to the current task. Use dynamic tool selection for systems with many tools.

## Practical Tips by Situation

### When Starting a New Project

1. **Choose your model by effective context length, not advertised.** 200K effective beats 1M advertised but 150K effective.
2. **Structure prompts for caching.** Stable content before dynamic content.
3. **Set up token monitoring from day one.** Retrofitting is harder than building in.

### When Conversations Get Long

4. **Trigger compaction at 64-75% capacity**, not 90%+ where degradation has already started.
5. **Start with tool result clearing** — the safest compression (lose raw data, keep decisions).
6. **Write key decisions to external storage.** CLAUDE.md files, scratchpads, and memory files survive compaction; context does not.

### When Costs Are Too High

7. **Enable prompt caching first** — minimal code change, up to 90% savings.
8. **Audit your token breakdown** to find the biggest consumers.
9. **Route simple tasks to cheaper models.** Use frontier models only for complex reasoning.
10. **Add semantic caching** for repeated queries (up to 73% savings).

### When Accuracy Is Degrading

11. **Check context length.** If near the effective limit, reduce context or switch models.
12. **Check information position.** Move critical content to beginning or end.
13. **Check for context poisoning.** Look for hallucinations from earlier turns being treated as facts.
14. **Reduce noise.** Remove irrelevant documents, unused tool definitions, unnecessary history.

### When Using AI Coding Agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

15. **Start fresh sessions when tasks go off track** rather than debugging in degraded context.
16. **Use `/compact` manually at logical breakpoints** (between features, after completing subtasks).
17. **Disable MCP servers you're not using.** Each costs thousands of tokens.
18. **Use sub-agents for file-reading-heavy tasks** to keep the main context clean.
19. **Check `/context`** to see where your tokens are going.

## Quick-Start Checklist

For developers building LLM-powered applications today:

- [ ] **Measure** your current token usage per request type
- [ ] **Enable prompt caching** (one line for Anthropic, automatic for OpenAI)
- [ ] **Set `max_tokens`** on every API call
- [ ] **Structure prompts** with stable content first, dynamic content after
- [ ] **Constrain output** in your prompts ("Answer in N words", "Return only JSON")
- [ ] **Remove verbose phrasing** from system prompts
- [ ] **Audit tool definitions** — disable unused tools
- [ ] **Test with production-length contexts** (not just short test inputs)
- [ ] **Set up monitoring** for token usage, cache hits, and latency
- [ ] **Define context budgets** for each component (prompt, tools, history, retrieval)

## The Bigger Picture

Context engineering is ultimately about respecting a constraint that many developers want to ignore: the context window is finite, expensive, and imperfect. Models don't use all of it equally. They struggle with information in the middle. They degrade as context grows. They charge for every token.

The developers who build the best LLM applications are the ones who internalize this constraint and design around it — not by hoping for larger windows, but by curating smaller, better ones.

Anthropic's engineering team puts it in 17 words:

> **"Find the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of some desired outcome."**

That sentence is the entire discipline. Everything else is implementation detail.
